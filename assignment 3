  Program : Is it a Palindrome?
  Description : A game which identifies if certain words are Palindromes
VARIABLE DICTIONARY
  w = To a list of words
  i(int) = Assigned to 0
  length(int) = length of x
  Palindrome = False
  x = Every individual word
"""

w = ["level", "noon", "goal", "radar", "bed", "soccer", "civic", "hotel", "cake", "madam"]  # assigns to list of words 

for x in w:  #loop through each individual word in the list

  palindrome = True  # sets variable palindrome to True

  length = len(x)  # Sets length to length of x 

  i = 0  # i is set to 0

  while i < length // 2:  # While i less than the amount of times 2 goes into length 

    if x[i] != x[length - 1 - i]:  # Compares the length from the front to the back 

      palindrome = False  # if previouse line is true than Palindrome is set to False 
 
    i += 1  # 1 is added to i

  if palindrome:  # if palindrome is True

    print(x , "is a palindrome")  # x is a palindrome 

  else:  # else 

    print(x , "is not a palindrome")  # x is not a palindrome
